* TODO Core functionality
  - [ ] Reverse merging for data conditions
  - [ ] Fix superloop detection (not working well when execute cg.a.32)
  - [ ] Revise memory leakage. Reprogram all destructors of implemented
    classes.
  - [ ] Aliased loops can not be freed by Loop destructor because SIGSEGV
    appears. Think about where to free them.
  - [ ] Hidden superloops can not be freed by Loop destructor because SIGSEGV
    appears. Think about where to free them.
  - [ ] Bad behavior when trace duration is about 2^32. It should be because
    some casting to integer.
* TODO Paraver interoperability
  - [ ] Even w/o compressing times, the iterations boundaries are degrading
    as bigger the iteration index is.
  - [ ] Sometimes paraver does not appear. Look at 1s delay before send
    signal.
  - [ ] Get the proper boundaries when user selects a bunch of iterations.
  - [ ] Program 'Max' and 'Min' buttons. These buttons should move the slider
    to the longest and shortest iterations of the selected loop.
  - [ ] When close paraver, it is not showed up again.
* TODO Property grid
  - [X] Program 'Time units' and 'Size units'.
  - [X] Whenever a pipeline option is shown, a dialog should be launched
    asking to user if pipeline should be re-runned.
* TODO Dataview
  - [ ] Save fold/unfold state before modify the model in order to restore
    it after the model changes.
  - [ ] Look at '+' and '-' buttons, they are not behaving well in some
    situations.
  - [X] Change '0' per '-'
  - [ ] When MPI calls are filtered by rank, CPU burst info is not showed up
  - [ ] Show callpath of every MPI call as a contextual panel(?) that pops-up
    when user maintains mouse pointer over a given mpi call.
  - [ ] When there is a hidden superloop the delta functions are not showed
    correctly on gnuplot
* TODO GUI
  - [X] Legend is only shown when a resize of the windows is done.
  - [ ] Process does not end when close the interface.
